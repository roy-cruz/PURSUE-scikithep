    "* Scikit-HEP is a community-driven project. It is a software ecosystem designed to provide a coherent collection of Python libraries for HEP. It is aimed at standardizing data analysis in HEP.\n",
    "* It integrates with other tools such as Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib and Scikit-Learn.\n",
    "* Among its major packages we have\n",
    "  * Uproot: For reading and writing ROOT files without requiring ROOT.\n",
    "  * Awkward Arrays: For the handling of jagged data structures\n",
    "  * Hist: For creating and manipulating histograms\n",
    "  * Vector: For manipulating and oprating on vectors of different kinds in a high-performance manner\n",
    "  * Boost-Histogram: For fast, multi-dimensional histogramming\n",
    "  * Particle: For handling particle physics data, including properties and PDG codes\n",
    "  * Iminuit: For fitting\n",
    "* In this tutorial, you will be introduced to the main components of the Scikit-HEP project. We will start with Uproot and build from there.\n",
    "* For more information on the Scikit-HEP project and the tools it offers, please visit the official website [Scikit-HEP Project Website](https://scikit-hep.org/)\n",

    "## ROOT Files\n",
    "\n",
    "* ROOT files are a binary format designed for storage and analysis of large amounts of HEP data. It structured hierarchically like a small filesystem which can contain nested directories.\n",
    "* It can contain a variety of data types such as TTrees and histograms.\n",
